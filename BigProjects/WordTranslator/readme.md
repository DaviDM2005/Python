# Python Dictionary Application

This Python application serves as a simple interactive dictionary. It loads data from a JSON file (`data.json`) containing words and their corresponding meanings. The application provides definitions for entered words, suggests similar words for potential misspellings, and allows users to choose from suggested alternatives.

## Functionality

### `describe(word: str) -> str or list`

The `describe` function takes a word as input and returns either the definition of the word or a list of suggested alternatives if the word is not found. It uses case-insensitive matching and provides close matches using the `get_close_matches` function from the `difflib` library.

### `format_output(output: str or list)`

The `format_output` function prints the output of the `describe` function in a user-friendly format. If the output is a single string, it prints the string. If the output is a list, it prints each item in the list with corresponding indices.

### Main Loop

The main loop of the program continuously prompts the user to enter a word. It checks if the entered word is in the dictionary or provides suggestions for similar words. The user can also type 'exit' to terminate the program.

## Example Usage:

```python
import json
from difflib import get_close_matches, SequenceMatcher

# ... (rest of the code)

while True:
    word = input("\nEnter the word or type 'exit': ")

    if word == "exit":
        print("Bye bye!")
        break

    format_output(describe(word))
